Enhanced-Stack
==============

A functioning, generic enhanced stack class written in Java. Nodes with accompanying data can be pushed and popped off the stack, and the minimum item in the stack is kept track of. The stack inherits from Iterable and has an iterator inner class to assists in iterating through the sequence of items the stack consists of.
